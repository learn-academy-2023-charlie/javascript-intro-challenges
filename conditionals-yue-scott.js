// Challenges
// Copy the challenges into your JavaScript file. Comment out the instructions and code the solution to each problem beneath the prompt.

// Write the code that will log true or false for the following:

// Is 34 divided by 3 greater than 67 divided by 2?
var x = 34/3
var y = 67/2
if(x>y){
    console.log("Yes!");
} else{
    console.log("No!");
}
// output No!

// Does 5 evaluate to the same as "5"?
var answer="5"
if(answer=5){
    console.log("This is Ture!");
}else {
    console.log("This is False!");    
    }
// output This is Ture!


// Does 5 strictly equal "5"?
var answer="5"
if(answer===5){
    console.log("This is Ture!");
}else {
    console.log("This is False!");    
    }
// output This is False!

// Does !3 strictly equal 3?
var answer = 3
if(answer===!3){
    console.log("This is Ture!");
}else {
    console.log("This is False!");
}
// output This is False!


// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 AND "Student".length strictly equal 7?
var LEARN = 5
var Student = 7
if(LEARN==="LEARN".length && Student==="Student".length){
    console.log("This is Ture!");
}else {
    console.log("This is False!");
}
// output This is Ture!

// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 OR "Student".length strictly equal 10?
var LEARN = 5
var Student = 10
if(LEARN==="LEARN".length || Student==="Student".length){
    console.log("This is Ture!");
}else {
    console.log("This is False!");
}
// output This is Ture!

// Does "LEARN" contain the subset "RN"?
var answer1 = "R"
var answer2 = "N"
if(answer1==="LEARN"[3] && answer2==="LEARN"[4]){
    console.log("This is Ture!");
}else {
    console.log("This is False!");
}

// Does "LEARN" contain the subset "rn"?


// Does "LEARN"[0] strictly equal "l"?
var answer="l"
if(answer==="LEARN"[0]){
    console.log("This is Ture!");
}else {
    console.log("This is False!");
}
// output This is False!

// Modify the code from the previous question to return true.


// Make sure you try different options and change the variables to ensure properly working code.

// Write a statement that takes a variable of item and logs "in budget" if a price is $100 or less.

// Write a statement that takes a variable of hungry and logs "eat food" if you are hungry and "keep coding" if you are not hungry.

// Write a statement that takes a variable of trafficLight and logs "go" if the light is green, "slow down" if the light is yellow and "stop" if the light is red.

// Write a statement that takes two variables that are numbers and outputs the larger number. If the numbers are equal, output "the numbers are the same".

// Write a statement that takes a variable of a number and logs whether the number is odd, even, or zero.
